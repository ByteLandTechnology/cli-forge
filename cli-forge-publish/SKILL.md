# cli-forge Publish

Use this stage when a compliant generated CLI skill needs to adopt standard
release automation, prepare a new version, or execute the paired GitHub
Release + multi-package npm publication flow.

## Purpose

Manage the release pipeline for a generated `cli-forge` skill.

This stage owns the bootstrap + production publication flow:

- a required local **prepublish** step for the main package plus all platform
  packages
- the paired **repo-native GitHub Release plus platform-split npm
  publication** from the later semantic-release event

One production release produces:

- git tag `v<version>` + GitHub Release (archive + sha256 per target)
- 6 per-platform npm packages (`<pkg>-darwin-arm64` / `-darwin-x64` /
  `-linux-arm64` / `-linux-x64` / `-win32-arm64` / `-win32-x64`) carrying the
  native binaries
- 1 main npm package (JS shim, `optionalDependencies` pinned to the same
  version)
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry + `chore(release): <version> [skip ci]` commit

All npm packages publish in one semantic-release run and share the
version with the git tag + GitHub Release. The total count is
`1 + config.targets.length` (default: 7).

## Entry Gate

| #   | Check                                                                 | Source        |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | `validation-report.yml` exists, is fresh, and `result == compliant` or `warning` | Validate      |
| 2   | Target repository path is explicitly known                            | Router / User |
| 3   | Requested publish mode is explicit                                    | Router / User |
| 4   | npm package naming contract, CLI name, and scope decisions are explicit | User        |

Scope decisions are required inputs at this stage. Collect the main package
name plus the scope policy for both the main package and the platform
packages. The main package and platform packages may use different scopes, but
platform names must still derive from the main package body plus
`-<target-suffix>`.

## Required Inputs

- Validation outcome plus provenance snapshot (refusal to publish if `non_compliant`, stale, or provenance-mismatched)
- Publish mode: `report_only`, `dry_run`, `prepublish`, or `live_release`
- Source project path
- `cliName` — the CLI binary name
- `mainPackageName` — the main npm package name (with scope prefix if scoped)
- `mainNpmScope` — `null` for unscoped, or the scope string for the main package
- `platformNpmScope` — `null` for unscoped platform packages, or a separate scope string
- `sourceRepository` — `owner/repo` on GitHub

## Workflow

1. Read [`./planning-brief.md`](./planning-brief.md) for publish-specific
   planning constraints.
2. Accept the inbound `validation-report.yml`. Refuse to proceed if validation
   failed; do not re-run validation here.
3. Verify validation freshness before any publish-mode action:
   - compare the current `.cli-forge/design-contract.yml`,
     `.cli-forge/cli-plan.yml`, baseline receipt (`scaffold-receipt.yml` or
     `takeover-receipt.yml`), and optional `extend-receipt.yml` against the
     provenance snapshot recorded in `validation-report.yml`
   - for takeover-adopted baselines, require the report provenance to match the
     current adopted contract + receipt set exactly; do not rely only on the
     aggregate validation result
   - if any required baseline artifact is missing, has a different receipt, or
     takeover recorded contract/baseline rewrites after validation, stop and
     route back to Validate
4. Ask the user for the inputs listed above if not already collected. If the
   mode is `report_only`, skip to step 7.
5. If the skill project lacks the release automation assets, adopt them by
   copying the contents of `./templates/` to the project root. The adopted
   asset pack does NOT contain Scaffold-stage source templates (`*.tpl`).
6. Fill `release/config.json` and `npm/main/package.json` with the collected
   inputs. `release/config.json` must explicitly record `mainPackageName`,
   `mainNpmScope`, and `platformNpmScope`.
7. Verify the target repository has:
   - GitHub Actions enabled on a GitHub-hosted runner with `id-token: write`
   - npm trusted publishing configured on npmjs.com for the main package and
     for each of the 6 platform packages, every entry pointing at `release.yml`
8. Follow the mode path defined in
   [`./instructions/release/skill-release-runbook.md`](./instructions/release/skill-release-runbook.md):
   - `report_only`: audit readiness only. Read config and repository state,
     report blockers and next actions. Do NOT copy files, fill placeholders,
     or alter the repository in any way.
   - `dry_run`: run `npm run release:rehearse` locally. This builds every
     target, syncs platform packages, and runs `npm publish --dry-run` for
     each. No tag, no GitHub Release, no real npm publication.
   - `prepublish`: run `npm run release:prepublish` locally. This performs a
     real public npm bootstrap publish for every platform package and the main
     package using a dedicated bootstrap prerelease version. If local auth is
     missing, pause for interactive `npm login`, surface the verification URL,
     and continue only after the user completes browser verification.
   - `live_release`: push to `main` (or `workflow_dispatch`) so
     `.github/workflows/release.yml` drives the end-to-end run. Do not proceed
     to `live_release` until prepublish bootstrap has completed for the configured
     package set.
9. Generate `.cli-forge/release-receipt.yml` from the template at
   [`./contracts/release-receipt.yml.tpl`](./contracts/release-receipt.yml.tpl).

## Outputs

- A verified prepublish bootstrap for 1 main + N platform npm packages (if `prepublish`)
- A verified GitHub Release with archives + checksums (if `live_release`)
- 1 main + N platform npm packages published at the same production version (if `live_release`)
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and release commit on `main`
- `.cli-forge/release-receipt.yml`

## Exit Gate

| 1   | The requested mode was executed                                         |
| 2   | For `report_only`: no files were written to the target repository       |
| 3   | For `dry_run` / `prepublish` / `live_release`: asset pack adopted and filled |
| 4   | For `prepublish`: the bootstrap npm prerelease completed without creating a tag or GitHub Release |
| 5   | For `live_release`: version, tag, main package, platform packages agree |
| 6   | `release-receipt.yml` generated                                         |

## Guardrails

- All npm packages (main + platforms) MUST share the version chosen by
  semantic-release. The two release scripts enforce this by consuming
  `${nextRelease.version}` from semantic-release hooks.
- The bootstrap prepublish step MUST use a dedicated prerelease version such as
  `0.0.0-prepublish.N`. It is not a production release.
- Main and platform packages may differ only by scope. Do not introduce
  arbitrary per-platform package base names.
- Do not bypass stale validation. If the codebase changed since the last
  validation report, route back to Validate.
- For takeover-adopted repositories, freshness checks MUST verify provenance
  against the current contract + receipt set, not just `validation-report.yml`
  aggregate status or timestamp.
- Do not hand-bump `npm/main/package.json#version`, hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`
  release entries, or create tags outside semantic-release.
- Interactive `npm login` guidance belongs only to local `prepublish`.
  Production CI publication must continue to rely on trusted publishing.
- The asset pack's `npm/platforms/` directory is generated at release time.
  Do not check generated platform package directories into source control
  beyond the `.gitkeep` placeholder.
