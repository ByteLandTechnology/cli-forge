# cli-forge Router

Use this parent skill as the stable entry point for the full `cli-forge`
workflow.

This skill does not do any design, planning, or implementation work itself. Its
job is to identify the current stage, recover the earliest incomplete phase from
the repository state, assemble required inputs, and route work to the correct
child skill.

## Purpose

Act as the intake layer and traffic controller.

- Classify requests into one of seven downstream stages: Design, Takeover,
  Plan, Scaffold, Extend, Validate, or Publish.
- Check the current filesystem state (presence of directories, base files,
  validation reports).
- Assemble inputs and generate the `handoff.yml` contract.
- Resume interrupted workflows when the user provides partial context.

## Entry Gate

| #   | Check               | Source |
| --- | ------------------- | ------ |
| 1   | User request exists | User   |

## Required Inputs

- The user request (explicit or ambiguous)
- Target directory path. **CRITICAL**: If the user does not provide the project
  path, you MUST actively search the workspace for `.cli-forge/` directories to
  locate the active project. If the request appears to target a pre-existing
  Rust CLI project that has not yet adopted `cli-forge`, search for likely
  project roots such as `Cargo.toml` plus `src/main.rs`, or explicitly ask the
  user for the path. Do not assume the root directory is the target project.

## Workflow

1. Read the user request and classify the expected outcome.
2. Inspect the filesystem to disambiguate the stage:
   - Missing target directory + new request -> Design
   - `design-contract.yml` exists but no `cli-plan.yml` -> Plan
   - Existing project with source files already present + missing
     `.cli-forge/design-contract.yml` -> Takeover
   - Existing project with source files already present + missing both
     `.cli-forge/design-contract.yml` and `.cli-forge/cli-plan.yml` -> Takeover
   - `cli-plan.yml` exists but no source files -> Scaffold
   - Existing project + feature request (`stream` or `repl`) + scaffold-compatible
     baseline -> Extend
   - Existing project + daemon capability request -> Plan
   - Existing project + audit request (or post-edit verification) -> Validate
   - Passed validation + release request (including npm publication) ->
     Publish
3. Confirm the required inputs for the chosen path:
   - Scaffold: `skill_name`
   - Takeover: `project_path`, `post_adoption_objective`, and `takeover_mode`
   - Extend: `project_path` and `feature` (`stream` or `repl`)
   - Plan: daemon capability requests, daemon contract changes, or daemon scope updates
   - Validate: `project_path`
   - Publish: `publish_mode`
4. Ensure the target project's `.cli-forge/` directory exists before writing
   any router artifact. This first-write barrier also applies to
   first-adoption repositories that do not yet carry any pipeline files.
5. Use the template at `contracts/handoff.yml.tpl` to generate
   `.cli-forge/handoff.yml` in the target project directory. This explicitly
   records the classification and inputs for downstream consumption.
6. Provide a clear handoff response specifying which child skill should be
   invoked next. When there are 2 or 3 legal next-stage options, call
   the runtime's dialog-based chooser (e.g., `AskUserQuestion`) with those options
   (recommended path first) when it is available. If no dialog-based chooser is
   available, or
   if only one legal next stage remains, present a numbered text menu with 1 to
   3 explicit next-stage options drawn only from the stages that remain valid
   under the current filesystem state. Use the smallest valid set, and when
   only one legal next stage exists, show a single `1.` option for that stage.
   Put the recommended path first and add `Other: explain a routing concern` as
   an escape hatch. Accept only the exact digits that correspond to the
   numbered options actually shown, or `Other: ...`. Do not auto-map
   plain-language replies onto numbered options. If a numeric reply includes
   additional text, or if an `Other:` reply asks for a stage that conflicts
   with the pipeline guardrails, ask for clarification and keep the handoff
   within the valid stage set. Do not require the user to type an exact phrase
   or skill name.

## Outputs

- `.cli-forge/handoff.yml` — The explicit routing contract

## Exit Gate

| #   | Check                                              |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Request intent classified successfully             |
| 2   | Required inputs for the downstream stage assembled |
| 3   | `handoff.yml` generated                            |
| 4   | Explicit handoff made to the correct child stage   |

## Guardrails

- **CRITICAL DIRECTIVE TO THE ASSISTANT**: You MUST NOT bypass the staged pipeline. Do not write, generate, or scaffold code yourself during this stage.
- **CRITICAL DIRECTIVE TO THE ASSISTANT**: You MUST STOP and yield to the user after generating `handoff.yml` and explaining the next steps. Do not invoke the next stage autonomously. Use the runtime's dialog-based chooser (e.g., `AskUserQuestion`) for the handoff when it is available and there are 2 or 3 legal next-stage options. If no dialog-based chooser is available, or if only one legal next stage remains, use the standardized numbered text fallback with `Other: explain a routing concern`. Never require the user to explicitly type the next skill name, and never let fallback input bypass the valid stage set computed from repository state.
- The Router must stay thin. Do not execute templates, run compilation steps, or define CLI contracts here.
- Never force a workflow forward if an earlier stage is incomplete. For
  example, if the user asks to "validate" but the project is a pre-existing
  repository with no usable contract baseline, route to Takeover before
  Validate. If `design-contract.yml` already exists but `cli-plan.yml` does
  not, resume Plan instead of rebuilding contracts from implementation. If the
  user has an approved `cli-plan.yml` but no generated source tree yet, route
  to Scaffold.
- If the user asks for a release but validation is missing or stale, route to
  Validate first.
- If the user asks to add daemon support to an existing project, route to Plan
  first so the daemon capability contract can be updated explicitly. Do not
  send daemon requests to Extend until dedicated daemon implementation support
  exists there.
- If an existing Rust CLI project with source files already present lacks a
  usable contract baseline, do not send it directly to Design, Scaffold,
  Extend, or Validate. Route it to Takeover only when the repository is
  missing `.cli-forge/design-contract.yml`, or when the user explicitly asks
  to refresh the adopted contracts, or when a downstream stage needs
  takeover baseline establishment because the contracts exist but no usable
  baseline receipt does. If `design-contract.yml` is already approved,
  preserve that Design -> Plan resume path instead of routing back through
  Takeover unless the user explicitly asked for takeover refresh or baseline
  establishment.
- Do not route arbitrary takeover-adopted projects to Extend. Extend is only
  valid when the current project layout already matches the scaffold-compatible
  files that the feature templates patch directly.
- Do not route new work to `cli-forge-distribute`. npm publication is part of
  Publish; the `cli-forge-distribute` module was archived in the daemon
  implementation commit and no longer exists.
- If the target project directory is unknown, you MUST ask the user or search
  for `.cli-forge/` folders. When takeover is likely, also search for probable
  Rust CLI project roots. Do not assume the current working directory applies.
